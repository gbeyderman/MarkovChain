Purchase Modeling using Clickstream Data and Markov Chains

The application that will be presented: Analyzing my own businessâ€™s clickstream data with Markov Chain techniques. Predicting clicks to purchase.

The computational statistics technique that will be demonstrated: Sequences of clicks, so called clickstreams, can either be analyzed by mining sequential patterns with algorithms such as Apriori or PrefixSpan or with probabilistic models such as Markov chains. I will attempt the latter approach.
